this is a simple http server in x64 asm cause asm is badass, i basically saw this guys video which was done in arm asm (https://github.com/dmtrKovalenko/macos-assembly-http-server) and wanted to convert it to x64 asm.
admittedly im not that good in x64 asm yet and dont know the x86/32 windows api functions so i used some chatgpt to help me build this. i put the C program to find the htons conversion for whatever ports at the bottom cause why not.
anyways this is really cool and im prob gonna make more x64 asm http servers cause i want to. and for anyone wondering, test.asm is just a basic minimal http server that i used for error testing since the port originally wasnt mapped correctly in main.asm.
